# Terminal-Manipulation
Personal project toying with terminal manipulation for Valentine's Day

This project uses a branching approach depending on if it is running on a windows or linux system.
The largest difference is the usage of Ascii art for the acceptance message.
- In Windows, this will be a rotating single-line message
- In Linux, this will be a rotating ASCII art piece with the same message

I used curses for the implementation of the rotating ASCII art on Linux.
Also, many props to this text to Ascii art generator I found, which greatly sped up the process: https://patorjk.com/software/taag/
